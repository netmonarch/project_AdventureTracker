<h1>Players</h1>
<?php ?>
This is where the DM will be able to look up their list of players.<br />
When moused over, the players' information will be here.<br />
Most important will be the players' chosen character sheet.<br />
Players must choose a character sheet to participate in an adventure.<br />
Once chosen, this choice cannot be undone except by the DM - in the case of player death or re-roll.<br />
